            <p>
                I am a native of the Ikpa Ibom clan in Mkpat Enin Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State.
                Born on December 19, 2006, in Eket LGA, I have a passion for sports such as football, basketball, 
                and table tennis. I also enjoy listening to music and watching movies. My ambition is to become 
                an Aeronautical Engineer, with a focus on piloting, maintaining, and building aircraft. This ambition 
                led me to learn programming, where I became a certified web designer. I am now looking forward to 
                becoming a Software Engineer and exploring various fields in technology.
